TASK-4
What Are Data Visualization Tools?

Data visualisation tools allow users to easily create graphics and imagery that help them make sense of large amounts of data. Graphs, maps, and charts allow them to quickly see trends, identify relationships, and uncover outliers in their data. The result is more informed decision-making, which can increase efficiency, revenue, and profits.
I have used Power Bi tool and used IRIS.csv dataset to represent the data.
